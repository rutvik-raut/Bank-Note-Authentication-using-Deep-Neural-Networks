# Bank-Note-Authentication-using-Deep-Neural-Networks

The banknote authentication dataset from UCI repository was used for the project.
The dataset consists of - 
1. Variance of Wavelet Transformed image
2. Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image
3. Kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed image
4. Entropy of image
5. Class

A Deep Neural Network using TensorFlow was developed to perform classification on the dataset. Also, a Random Forest Classifier was also developed, for a comparative purpose.
